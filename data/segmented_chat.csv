What was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday?,['Hard to keep a count. Maybe 25.'],1
Which holiday was that?,['I think it was Australia'],1
Do you still talk to the people you met?,"[""Not really. The interactions are usually short-lived but it's fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them""]",1
what do you mean?,"['I think it\'s like a 6th sense, often seen as ""cold readings"" to people, but can be remarkably accurate. I once sat next to a man in a coffee and I felt a pain in my back. I asked the stranger if he had a pain. It turns out that he did in the exact spot, and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party. I had never met the man before and never saw him again.', ""Wow! That's interesting, borderline spooky"", 'There\'s this practice called ""Treasure Hunting"" that\'s kind of a fun game you play in a public place. There\'s a book called ""The Ultimate Treasure Hunt"" that talks about it. You use your creativity to imagine people you will meet, and you write down a description, then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word. Maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination, then while at the mall, you may find someone who matches that description. You show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat. You then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart. You have no idea, sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day, and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love.']",3
"So, do you do treasure hunting often?","[""I did more when I was in grad school (and had more time). I would usually go with friends. For a while I would go to the farmers market in Santa Cruz every week and try to feel if there is something I am supposed to tell a stranger. Usually, they are vague hope-filled messages, but it's weird when I blurt out something oddly specific."", 'Hi']",2
Any plans for the weekend?,['my friends are gonna visit me this weekend. we might go hiking!'],1
Should be very sunny! you?,"['Cool! very depressing plans ... stay home and work ð\x9f\x98\x9e I have a project deadline very close.', 'ð\x9f\x98\x90 hope you get your work done very soon! a bug free weekend!']",2
"Right, very anxious! where do you plan to go for a hike?",['I am going to Diablo!'],1
"Nice, where is that place? I haven't been there",['hours drive from here. still in bay area'],1
That's cool! How long is the hike?,"['Actually no idea, but it will take the entire day for that.', 'nice! sounds fun!', 'Hi!']",3
"Nothing much, how you doin?","[""I'm in New York this week for Thanksgiving. I'm squatting in the office today and I caught up with an old friend of mine :D""]",1
Oh wow! Sounds like fun! When was the last time you had seen this friend?,"['The last time in New York, back in June.', ""Ohh okay. I was going to say if it had been a long time maybe it'd be awkward..."", ""Haha, I guess if it's been a very long time there's almost too many life events to catch up on.. especially recently""]",3
Haha it's probably too much to go into at the moment. Let's just say life is an exciting experience. How about you?,"['Ahhh sounds exciting indeed! My life is pretty bland. I like routine, but sometimes I wish I had more time for adventures!']",1
"Saturday looks pretty good, shall we shoot for something in the morning?","['Hi!', 'hey']",2

They make days gloomy"", ""yeah but I think it's good to have some rainy days in bay area, it's pretty dry here ð\x9f\x98\x9b"", 'Where I grew up, we had lots of water trouble too...', ""yeah like wise, I've seen a pretty bad snowstorm when I was at my undergrad school, all flights canceled and traffics went down"", ""Haha... I don't think I can survive in that weather ever. Just the rains at 50 degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms""]",6
yeah how do you like it in bay area though? I think we need more rain here,"['people say there is drought here... but we have 24 hours water supply here ... lol... never seen that in a drought ridden area', ""it is pretty dry in the mountains I believe, that's what causes fire""]",2

"If you could go anywhere on vacation, where would you go?","['I like rainforest, but I know it requires extensive training beforehand.', 'I heard there are rainforests in southeast Asia where you can zipline from tree to tree.', 'I am afraid I will be scared of doing this :)', ""I won't lie, it sounds scary. I'm scared right now just thinking about it."", ""I don't know if there is any medication for acrophobia. I want to take plenty of it if I really have to do it."", ""If there isn't one, you should invent it, and then make millions"", ""That's a great idea! Maybe alcohol is such a thing."", ""Ha! Don't drink and zipline, mate!"", ""Oops. I won't do it again. Ha"", 'Hi!', 'Hey sup']",11

"I have never seen Avatar, what is it about? I really enjoy the Avenger movies","[""it's a science-fiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with non-human creatures. people figured out a way to join that nature through Avatar transformation. the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors, e.g., cutting trees, have affected nature"", 'That sounds really cool!

lol Sorry to hear that. Are you planning anything fun for December?,"[""Nothing exciting. I'll be posted up at home for the most part. I did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if I wasn't sick."", 'ð\x9f\x98\x82']",2
Do you have big plans?,"['Yes! I am going to Hawaii! This will be my first time visiting Hawaii. Really excited about it.', ""I love Hawaii. It's a good place to be. I like going there cause it's humid so I never have to put on lotion."", 'lol this is the first time I heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion. I cannot agree more.', ""Brooooo!!! It's so important. When I got to California beaches I have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day."", 'ð\x9f\x98\x82', 'Hi!']",6
Getting better. I just recovered from a cold. I got wet in the rain last week. Are you planning anything for the holidays?,"[""Glad to hear you're better. Sorry to hear you were sick. I was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough. There's definitely a bug going around. Admit I just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax."", 'Oh same here. I think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays.', ""Definitely! I know a lot of folks travel for the holidays, but I'm happy to stay home myself!""]",3
"I'm getting there. Every year until last year, I tried to go somewhere for the Christmas / New Year, and then I got bored traveling. lol not sure if that means I'm getting old?","[""Me too. Now I have folks come visit me for the holidays! But that's also tiresome..""]",1
Are you doing any home decorating then?,"['Yes! We set up an eco-friendly (i.e. fake) Christmas tree and put up some colorful LED lights which is very festive.', ""I think I'm copying you. Me and my wife plan to decorate and Christmas tree too. We bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores, but haven't yet to buy the tree."", 'Buying a tree is a neat experience. I was torn between buying an artificial/eco-friendly/fake one vs. a real one that smells like fresh pine. In the end, we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year.']",3
"I see. Artificial anything is better, from tree to intelligence, huh?","['Oh, very clever pun! I like it! Depends. I remember having real Christmas trees from childhood, but these days with climate change, I think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do.']",1
I see. It's probably also cheaper. I'll buy an artificial one too. Do you have any suggestions for the store?,"['Admit my favorite store is Target, plus they often have good deals.', ""Ah that's great. My wife also likes Target a lot. She even made a Target credit card because she comes to that store very often. Okay thanks for the suggestion. I'll check out Target."", 'Great, I hope you find a nice tree.', 'Hi!', 'Hey']",5

"Wow, sounds very busy! Do you with money at those horse vaulting competitions?","['Yeah some. enough to get by', 'Hi!', 'Hello']",3
Nice! Lotus looks pretty cool and It has some delightful vibe. So what is this research about?,"[""Oh, it's not research! Just a personal theory. I think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate.""]",1
Interesting! Whats your favorite flower?,"['The gerbera. It\'s like a cartoon flower. As if you drew ""flower"" with a crayon and then it came to life.', 'Nice, i would love know more about your theory. Like how you can deduce personality from flower preference.']",2
"Ok, step 1 is, you ask someone what their favourite flower is. Pretty much like what we just did. Does that make sense so far?","['yes', ""Cool. Step 2: talk with the person some more, and ask them some more questions, and gradually develop a sense of what they're like, over the course of maybe two to five years. And voila"", 'Hehe, i think you should publish this someday :)', ""Why thank you, that's a wonderful idea!"", 'Hi!', ""Hey how's it going""]",6

"Oh wow! I'm not on that level yet, but I understand the appeal. Are you an adrenaline junkie at all?","[""No, the opposite. I can't stand heights, horror movies, or confined spaces."", ""Same! I guess the roller coaster wasn't so bad because I trust the engineering haha""]",2
"Maybe not so much at the time, but I am glad I did it now that it's done, know what I mean?","['I think I sort of understand :)', 'Hi!']",2

what does a volunteer do?,"['Volunteers have to book the place before the event, send out details of the event to participants, handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly. It will be fun!', 'That sounds fun, I hope I get to participate as well']",2
Great! Do you have any preference for any of these events?,"['I think badminton would be fun to help out with I used to play it with my siblings', 'Cool! I will add you for the event. I think its best to start discussing the format of the event. There are a couple of other volunteers for badminton, i can connect you with them.']",2
"Ah, I forgot to ask, has there been a date picked?","['Its next saturday. Actually Depending on how long we get the place reserved, it may slip to sunday as well.', ""That's coming up soon!"", 'True! The volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds. Now, we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event.', 'Phew, yes I can help with that']",4
Perfect! We have a meeting today at 4.30 pm. Is it fine if i add you to it?,"['yes happy to help', 'Hi!', 'Hello there!']",3
WHAT? Why would you do that? Take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting?,"[""I actually don't have a choice. I'm an acupuncturist and all my clients want to be treated on the weekend!""]",1
Wow. The game is brutal like that. I've always been sceptical of acupuncture. Like...does it even work? Why? How? Where is the literature?,"[""I went to school for it and so I find the literature quite convincing. I've also seen its benefits firsthand in my practice. It revolves around the Chinese notion of Qi.""]",1
"Haha. All good questions! I don't have studies on hand at the moment, but perhaps I can send some to you later! What do you do for work?","[""I'm a comic.""]",1
Oh wow! What's your best joke?,"[""It's not appropriate to say here but I assure you it's VERY funny."", 'Haha fantastic', 'Hi!']",3

"Haha, beach season is coming! You need to look tan! What did you do indoors all day?","[""I mostly work. Sometimes I try looking at at beach photos and pretending that I'm actually going to the beach.""]",1
"hahahaha, that's pretty funny. Ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach??","['All the times. My work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets. I just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react. Every time I do that, I think of going to the beach.']",1
"Hmm I see. It sounds like you work near the water already, no? Are you some kind of fish researcher?","[""Yes that's close. My research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish. Many of them a poisonous, but if processed correctly, they would make hi-end foods. I try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables.""]",1
Woah! This is very interesting! I have honestly never heard of such kind of work. Is it dangerous at all?,"[""Yes and no. Because it's obviously dangerous, we all have to wear protective clothes. Thus, accidents almost never happen."", 'Hmmm, yes I have heard that. Apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes, but on the easier routes, when their guard is down! Sounds like the same psychological phenomenon.']",2
I'm pretty amateur! I like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually. Ever tried it yourself?,"['I climb very occasionally. My fingertips are not strong enough so I never make too much progress.', 'Hi!', ""hi, what's up!""]",3
Everything is good. There's so much to be thankful for - especially coming out of Thanksgiving holidays. How are you?,"[""I'm doing well. holiday season is the best thing to have!""]",1

Cool. Where and what did you eat?,"[""I ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didn't make me want to travel far haha""]",1
thats a lot of meat what dish? Why are you consideringt o go vetegarian?,"[""Cause the environment and humans suck. I'm keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies. I mixed up a couple of dishes. It was a buffet style place.""]",1
I love it too. But depending on how it's prepared you can taste the peanut butter. But if prepared well I love it. What kind of food would you have eaten if it wasn't rainy?,"[""I didn't know that it had peanut butter in it"", 'Hi!', 'hi']",3
pretty good. How about you?,"[""I'm looking through some old photos of my home town, so I'm feeling nostalgic.""]",1
I feel you. Memeories always flood when looking at photos. Where is your hometown?,"[""It's called <REDACTED_TERM>, on the north coast of France."", 'Hope you can take some time to visit pretty soon!']",2
"Yes, that would be nice. Do you like travelling?",['Yes I do. But havenâ\x80\x99t been to many places yet'],1
